We work on self-driving cars and vessels that are capable of navigating in dense urban scenarios. We combine optimization and learning methods to model interaction and balance risk.
With our collaborators, we have deployed our motion planners on full-scale autonomous vehicles. See for example our demo at the ISTS`20 Conference ([Video](https://youtu.be/1QPKSckhe50?t=503))
