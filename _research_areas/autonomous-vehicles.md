Our research on autonomous vehicles focuses on motion planning algorithms that guarantee safety without being too conservative, in particular in dense urban scenarios where the vehicle must account for several pedestrians.
In collaboration with MIT, SMART and the Intelligent Vehicles (IV) group of Prof. Dariu Gavrila, we have deployed our motion planners on full-scale autonomous vehicles. See for example our demo at the ISTS`20 Conference ([Video](https://youtu.be/1QPKSckhe50?t=503))
