# Student Projects

## BSc internships / research assistant

Our department does not normally offer any such positions for external students. Contact [Javier Alonso-Mora](mailto:{{ site.contact_email }}) if you are interested in joining our group.

## MSc projects

These projects are primarily for students in the TUD MSc Robotics. In exceptional cases, we also supervise students from other MSc studies - if you are interested please see below the information that we require from you. Although projects can start anytime, most projects start in the fall and we try to announce them in the spring. We advise interested students to contact us several months before the intended start date.

All of our MSc Thesis + Literature Survey assignments can be extended with a Research Assignment in the same topic. This is an interesting option for students interested in a longer research experience (e.g. if you would like to publish an article during your MSc thesis or do a PhD afterwards). We do not offer separate Research Assignments - only those linked to an MSc thesis project. You may also choose to do an Internship in a company.

In the following link you can find a list of available MSc projects. For announced projects, please first contact the daily supervisor to discuss the project.

If you do not find an interesting project, but you would like to join our group, or your would like to propose your own project, then, send an email to Prof. J. Alonso-Mora.

We can also supervise TUD MSc students in industry or in our partners abroad. For example in one of our industrial partners or collaborators (e.g., MIT, Stanford, ETH Zurich, Harvard, TUM, etc). Send an email to Prof. J. Alonso-Mora if interested.

## Internships

Several companies working in robotics or transportation offer internships (and sometimes MSc projects) for MSc students. Some companies that you may reach out to are: 2getthere, SPOTS, Lowpad, Motional, TNO, The Routing Company, MOIA, Vanderlande, Siemens (autonomous cars), Lely, Verity Studios, any car manufacturer, Amazon (application is almost one year in advance), Demcon Unmanned Systems, Via, Uber, Ortec, Prime Vision, Connexxion... You may also find many more companies searching the websites of Robovalley and Yes! Delft.

<!-- ## Applications

We can occasionally accommodate (additional) highly motivated students in MSc projects or in ongoing projects before their graduation stage.

If you are interested in working on a project with us, please send us ca. 1 academic quarter before the intended starting date an e-mail including:
- a short CV
- BSc & MSc transcripts
- a short motivation letter
- any other information that might be relevant for the application

The motivation letter should state:
- what are you interested in? What would you like to achieve?
- the type of assignment you are interested in (more theoretical/more applied)
- whether you prefer a project at the TU or at a company
- the intended starting date
- your relevant experience (studies, technical projects, internships, hobbies, etc.)
- programming languages and related (C, C++, Python, ROS, etc.) -->
