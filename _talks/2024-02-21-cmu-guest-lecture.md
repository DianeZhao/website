abstract: When multiple agents operate in a common environment, their actions are naturally interdependent and this coupling complicates planning. In this lecture, we will approach this problem through the lens of dynamic game theory. We will discuss how to model multi-agent interactions as general-sum games over continuous states and actions, characterize solution concepts of such games, and highlight the key challenges of solving them in practice. Based on this foundation, we will review established techniques to tractably approximate game solutions for online decision-making. Finally, will discuss extensions of the game-theoretic framework to settings that involve incomplete knowledge about the intent, dynamics, or state of other agents.
