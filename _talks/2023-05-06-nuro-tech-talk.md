abstract: Contingency planning, wherein an agent generates a set of possible plans conditioned on the outcome of an uncertain event, is an increasingly popular way for robots to act under uncertainty. In this talk, it will be presented a game-theoretic perspective on contingency planning which is tailored to multi-agent scenarios in which a robot's actions impact the decisions of other agents and vice versa. The resulting contingency game allows the robot to efficiently coordinate with other agents by generating strategic motion plans conditioned on multiple possible intents of other actors in the scene. Beyond this new problem formulation, it will be (i) discussed an efficient method for solving $N$-player contingency games with nonlinear dynamics and non-convex costs and constraints, (ii) shown that this framework recovers existing variants of game-theoretic planning under uncertainty as special case, and (iii) demonstrated quantitative performance gains over game-theoretic motion plans that do not account for future uncertainty reduction.
