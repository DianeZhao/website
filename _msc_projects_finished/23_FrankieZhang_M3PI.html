description: "This project explores the use of Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control algorithm to enable autonomous robots to navigate complex environments. MPPI is a sampling-based control method that combines path planning and control into a single optimization problem. By iteratively sampling and optimizing trajectories, the algorithm generates control inputs that minimize a cost function while satisfying system dynamics and constraints. The project aims to implement and evaluate the performance of MPPI on a robot platform, showcasing its effectiveness in real-world scenarios."
