Hi! I am Jackal, a small and fast unmanned ground vehicle from Clearpath. Researchers in this group want me to navigate efficiently and safely around other decision making agents such as humans. But I don't come alone. I have three brothers, with whom I also like to navigate with. I contain the following perception hardware onboard: Five Intel RealSense D455 and one Ouster OS1-64 lidar. More information about me and my brothers can be found on this [page](https://clearpathrobotics.com/jackal-small-unmanned-ground-vehicle/#:~:text=Jackal%20is%20a%20small%2C%20fast,%2Dthe%2Dbox%20autonomous%20capability.).
