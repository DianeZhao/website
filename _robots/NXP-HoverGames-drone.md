Hi! My name is HoverGames and I am a drone kit brought to the market by the Dutch company NXP Semiconductors. Researchers in this group want me to fly autonomously and safely through a lab environment with obstacles. In order to accomplish this goal, I contain the following hardware onboard: Intel RealSense D455 camera, NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX module and a custom NXP flight controller board that is compatible with the PX4 autopilot stack. More information about me can be found on this [page](https://nxp.gitbook.io/hovergames/).
