Hi! My name is Mantis and I am a small but powerful quadcopter. I am made of carbon fiber and 3D-printed parts. I am equipped with Realsense D455 Camera and NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX module but my weight is only about 500 grams and my size is about 20 cm. My flight controller runs PX4 firmware. Researchers in this group use me to realize collision-free swarm flight.
