I am a new addition to the team and come with an identical twin. More information about the base can be found on this [page](https://clearpathrobotics.com/dingo-indoor-mobile-robot/) and about the arm on this [page](https://www.kinovarobotics.com/product/gen3-lite-robots) . Soon I will also be equipped with sensors.
