Hello there! I'm Dinova 1, one half of a dynamic duo of mobile manipulators working in cluttered environments shared with humans. With my identical twin by my side, I bring robust mobility and precise manipulation capabilities to enhance productivity and efficiency in diverse settings. More information about the base can be found on this [page](https://clearpathrobotics.com/dingo-indoor-mobile-robot/) and about the arm on this [page](https://www.kinovarobotics.com/product/gen3-lite-robots). Soon, we will also be equipped with sensors.
