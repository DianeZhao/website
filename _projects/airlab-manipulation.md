## About the Project

The AI for Retail (AIR) Lab Delft is a joint TU Delft-Ahold Delhaize industry lab. As part of the project, we develop novel method for trajectory generation for mobile manipulation. In the context of retail environments, it is especially important to generate motions that are safe in the proximity of humans. Special focus is on the combined trajectory generation of the robotic platform and the manipulator.
