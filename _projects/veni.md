  In this project, the focus is on enabling mobile robots to coexist with humans by developing novel control and communication methods to demonstrate safe motion in dynamic environments. These methods are then tested in real-life situations using autonomous boats navigating in canals and autonomous cars which will drive in an urban environment.

## About the Project

In a modern day smart city, a mobile robot needs to coexist with humans and other robots in a cluttered and dynamic environment. In the near future, fleets of autonomous boats and cars will be used for mobility on-demand. However, this would require developing control and communication methods which work for a variety of robotic systems and most importantly can be used in an ever changing surrounding. Previous research methods have typically...
