## About the Project

The AI for Retail (AIR) Lab Delft is a joint TU Delft-Ahold Delhaize industry lab. Part of the labs research focuses on On-Demand Last-Mile Logistics or Falsh Deliveries. More specifically, two fundamental questions critical for the success of these operations are tackled: the associated Vehicle Routing Problem and the associated Fleet Sizing Problem. This project aims to contribute algorithms to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the planning ot Flash Delivery operations
