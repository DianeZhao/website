  In this project, interactions of mobile robots and humans is key. This concept is considered on multiple spatio-temporal granularities ranging from individual interactions to the macro interaction of a robot fleet with humans, and from short term (local) to long term (global) effects of the interaction.

## About the Project

This project addresses the interaction of highly automated vehicles with vulnerable road users (VRU) such as pedestrians and cyclists, in the context of future urban mobility. The project pursues an integrated approach, covering the spectrum of VRU sensing, cooperative localization, behaviour modeling and intent recognition and vehicle control. Within the AMR group we focus on the vehicle control, enabling safe and efficient autonomous driving.
