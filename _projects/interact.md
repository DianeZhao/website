  In this project, interactions of mobile robots and humans is key. This concept is considered on multiple spatio-temporal granularities ranging from individual interactions to the macro interaction of a robot fleet with humans, and from short term (local) to long term (global) effects of the interaction.

## About the Project

INTERACT aims to equip mobile robots with the ability to navigate and operate safely in human-populated environments. Leveraging advancements in Motion Planning, Multi-robot Task Assignment, and Machine Learning, this project seeks to overcome the challenges of modeling intuition and ensuring safety in complex, uncertain settings. By developing intuitive models from past interactions and integrating them into novel optimization methods, INTERACT will enable robots to perform seamless, interaction-aware navigation and task planning. This foundational work paves the way for a new era of automation in both industrial and urban settings, where robots and humans can coexist harmoniously.
