## About the Project

This project addresses the interaction of highly automated vehicles with vulnerable road users (VRU) such as pedestrians and cyclists, in the context of future urban mobility. The project pursues an integrated approach, covering the spectrum of VRU sensing, cooperative localization, behaviour modeling and intent recognition and vehicle control. Within the AMR group we focus on the vehicle control, enabling safe and efficient autonomous driving.
